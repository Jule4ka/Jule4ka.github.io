<h3> About me </h3>
<div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between">
	<div style="max-width:70%" >
<p> Welcome! </p>

        <p>My name is Julia.</p>
<p>Originally from Ukraine, I’ve been living in Utrecht (NL) since 2017.</p>
<p> Work-wise, I’ve held various roles across software development and the financial services industry.
Currently, I’m working as a data and information specialist (engineering, analysis) in the energy sector.
For the new assignments/roles, I'm seeking for something at the intersection of technological innovation and social impact (in areas like, climate, sustainability, safety/peace, or education.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, my name is chaos 😄.  I jump into new things quickly, and I jump out of them even quicker.
Still, a few passions have stuck around over time: badminton, tennis, dancing, learning random stuff, languages, traveling, movies, and jazz.</p>

<p>This space is meant to be my personal platform to capture and express whatever I feel like sharing.</p>
