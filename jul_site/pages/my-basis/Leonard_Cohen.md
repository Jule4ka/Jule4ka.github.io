<h2> Nevermind </h2> <br>
The war was lost <br>
The treaty signed <br>
I was not caught <br>
I crossed the line <br><br>
I was not caught<br>
Though many tried<br>
I live among you<br>
Well disguised<br><br>
I had to leave<br>
My life behind<br>
I dug some graves<br>
You'll never find<br><br>
The story's told<br>
With facts and lies<br>
I had a name<br>
But nevermind<br><br>
Nevermind<br>
Nevermind<br>
The war was lost<br>
The treaty signed<br><br>
There's truth that lives<br>
And truth that dies<br>
I don't know which<br>
So nevermind<br><br>
[text in arabic]<br><br>
Your victory<br>
Was so complete<br>
That some among you<br>
Thought to keep<br><br>
A record of<br>
Our little lives<br>
The clothes we wore<br>
Our spoons our knives<br><br>
The games of luck<br>
Our soldiers played<br>
The stones we cut<br>
The songs we made<br><br>
Our law of peace<br>
Which understands<br>
A husband leads<br>
A wife commands<br><br>
And all of this<br>
Expressions of<br>
The sweet indifference<br>
Some call love<br><br>
The high indifference<br>
Some call fate<br>
But we had names<br>
More intimate<br><br>
Names so deep and<br>
Names so true<br>
They're blood to me<br>
They're dust to you<br><br>
There is no need<br>
That this survive<br>
There's truth that lives<br>
And truth that dies<br><br>
Nevermind<br>
Nevermind<br>
I live the life<br>
I left behind<br><br>
There's truth that lives<br>
And truht that dies<br>
I don't know which<br>
So nevermind<br><br>
[text in arabic]<br><br>
I could not kill<br>
The way you kill<br>
I could not hate<br>
I tried I failed<br><br>
You turned me in<br>
At least you tried<br>
You side with them<br>
Whom you despise<br><br>
This was your heart<br>
This swarm of flies<br>
This was once your mouth<br>
This bowl of lies<br><br>
You serve them well<br>
I'm not surprised<br>
You're of their kin<br>
You're of their kind<br><br>
Nevermind<br>
Nevermind<br>
I had to leave<br>
My life behind<br><br>
The story's told<br>
With facts and lies<br>
You own the world<br>
So nevermind<br><br>
Nevermind<br>
Nevermind<br>
I live the life<br>
I left behind<br><br>
I live it full<br>
I live it wide<br>
Through layers of time<br>
You can't divide<br><br>
My woman's here<br>
My children too<br>
Their graves are safe<br>
From ghosts like you<br><br>
In places deep<br>
With roots entwined<br>
I live the life I left behind<br><br>
The war was lost<br>
The treaty signed<br>
I was not caught<br>
I crossed the line<br><br>
I was not caught<br>
Though many tried<br>
I live among you<br>
Well disguised<br>
