<h3> About me </h3>

<p> Hi! I'm Julia.</p>
<p> I'm a data professional and aspiring data/investigative journalist currently based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.</p>
<p> Work-wise, Iâ€™ve worked across software development, financial services and energy industries in software/data roles (DWH/data engineer, data modeller,
    BI analyst, software automation engineer, exploratory tester). Lately, I've deliberately shifted towards more society-oriented organizations.
    At the moment, I work in the energy sector as a data and information specialist. For future assignments or roles, I'm looking for opportunities
    at the intersection of technological innovation and societal impact, in domains like climate, sustainability, energy or safety/defence. I did spent quite some
    time in the DWH/BI/data world and used a wide range of tools. But it's not about tools, surprise-surprise :) </p>
        <p>Education-wise, I hold 2 MS degrees: 'Software Engineering' + 'Information Systems'. I'm also continuously learning quite random stuff, just because I love it. </p>
        <p> Passion-wise, I've started exploring investigative and data journalism. Side projects, of course, while keeping a 'normal' job (and a bit of sanity). </p>
        <p> Leisure-wise, my name is chaos ðŸ˜„.  I jump into new things quickly, and I jump out of them even quicker. Still, a few passions have stuck around over time: racket sports, dancing, love for conferences, languages, traveling, movies, and jazz.</p>

<p>This site is meant to be my personal place to capture and express whatever I feel like sharing.</p>
