        <p> Hi! I'm Julia.</p>
        <p> This is what I had in my LinkedIn title, which I removed to actually get hired :)
            🌌 Navigating complexity through lived experience 🐙, reflection 🧠, ethics ❤,
            technology 🤖, and DIKW📚, hopefully for something good 🌍 or, at least, for having less part in lies, injustice & bs. </p>

        <p> I'm a data/information generalist and journalism enthusiast currently based in Utrecht, NL. There I live with Sachika, fishes, snails, shrimps and plants. </p>
<p> Work-wise, I’ve worked across software development, financial services and energy industries in software/data roles
    (DWH/data engineer, data modeller, BI analyst, implementation consultant, software automation engineer, exploratory tester). </p>
        <p>Education-wise, I hold 2 MS degrees: 'Software Engineering' + 'Information Systems'.
            I'm also continuously learning quite random stuff, just because I love it. </p>
        <p> Passion-wise, I've started exploring investigative and data journalism. Side projects, of course, while keeping a 'normal' job
            (and a bit of sanity). </p>
        <p> Leisure-wise, my name is chaos 😄.  I jump into new things quickly, and I jump out of them even quicker.
            Still, a few passions have stuck around: racket sports, dancing, hiking, skiing, trying to play trumpet and piano,
            love for conferences and philosophising,
            languages, traveling, movies, and jazz.</p>
<p>This site is meant to be my personal place to capture and express whatever I feel like sharing.</p>
<p>Other places you can find me online: <a href="https://github.com/Jule4ka">GitHub</a> where there could have been much more code;
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3531743-jule444ka">Goodreads</a> where I'm actively tracking what I read;
    <a href="https://www.icheckmovies.com/profiles/jule444ka/">ICheckMovies</a> where I'm finding what to watch;
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-paranich-4b326337/">Linkedin</a> where I'm searching for jobs and staying up to date with the hype of the moment.
