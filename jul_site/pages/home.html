<h3> About me </h3>

<p> Hi! I'm Julia.</p>
<p> I'm a data generalist and journalism enthusiast currently based in Utrecht, NL.</p>
<p> Work-wise, Iâ€™ve worked across software development, financial services and energy industries in software/data roles
    (DWH/data engineer, data modeller, BI analyst, implementation consultant, software automation engineer, exploratory tester). </p>
        <p>Education-wise, I hold 2 MS degrees: 'Software Engineering' + 'Information Systems'.
            I'm also continuously learning quite random stuff, just because I love it. </p>
        <p> Passion-wise, I've started exploring investigative and data journalism. Side projects, of course, while keeping a 'normal' job
            (and a bit of sanity). </p>
        <p> Leisure-wise, my name is chaos ðŸ˜„.  I jump into new things quickly, and I jump out of them even quicker.
            Still, a few passions have stuck around: racket sports, dancing, love for conferences and philosophising,
            languages, traveling, movies, and jazz.</p>
<p>This site is meant to be my personal place to capture and express whatever I feel like sharing.</p>
<p>Other places you can find me online: <a href="https://github.com/Jule4ka">GitHub</a> where there could have been much more code;
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3531743-jule444ka">Goodreads</a> where I'm actively tracking what I read;
    <a href="https://www.icheckmovies.com/profiles/jule444ka/">ICheckMovies</a> where I'm finding what to watch;
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-paranich-4b326337/">Linkedin</a> where I'm searching for jobs and stay up to date.
