## That's where I am learning from

###Courses

<p>2021:</p>
- [Moralities of Everyday Life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/moralities/home/welcome) via Coursera, by Paul Bloom - wide exposure to different perspectives. Paul Bloom is a sweetheart :)
- [Justice](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+ER22.1x+2T2020/home) via edx, by Michael Sandel - eye-opening and controversial. So far the best content-wise.
- [Black Box Software Testing](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/bbst-black-box-software-testing-courses/) - contents-rich and gives a very comprehensive fundament. With a lot of heavy material and homework.
- [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) - nice intro
- [Rapid Software Testing Explored](https://www.satisfice.com/rapid-software-testing-explored) with James Bach - I want to do more. Impressive
- Commercial certifications (I've done them but not worthy to be described in details) 

### Humans

<p>These humans inspired me and enabled me to move forward.</p> 
- James Bach
- Paul Bloom
- Judith Butler

### Conferences and Talks list

I came to realisation that conferences and talks can and do bring value

### 2021
- TestBash Home 2021 (from Ministry of Testing, comes with Pro subscription) - not attended live, but watched some talks
    - Panel: What is Quality
    - Bullshit Alert! On the Bullshitisation of Software Testing (with Maaike Brinkhof) - simply wonderful
    - Empathy in the Foundation of Testing - didn't finish...
    - Do You Know How to Ask a Question - didn't finish...
