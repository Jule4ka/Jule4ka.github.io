That's where I am learning from
===============================================

Courses
-----------------
2021:
~~~~~~~~
* Moralities of Everyday Life link_ via Coursera, by Paul Bloom - wide exposure to different perspectives. Paul Bloom is a sweetheart :)
* Justice link1_ via edx, by Michael Sandel - eye-opening and controversial. So far the best content-wise.
* Black Box Software Testing link2_ - contents-rich and gives a very comprehensive fundament. With a lot of heavy material and homework.
* Python Koans link3_ - nice intro
* Rapid Software Testing Explored link4_ with James Bach - I want to do more. Impressive
* Commercial certifications (not worthy to be described in details)

Conferences and Talks list
