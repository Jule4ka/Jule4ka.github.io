# Courses list

Those are wonderful courses I followed:

- [Moralities of Everyday Life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/moralities/home/welcome) via Coursera, by Paul Bloom - wide exposure to different perspectives. Paul Bloom is a sweetheart :)
- [Justice](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+ER22.1x+2T2020/home) via edx, by Michael Sandel - eye-opening and controversial. So far the best content-wise.
- [Black Box Software Testing](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/bbst-black-box-software-testing-courses/) - contents-rich and gives a very comprehensive fundament. With a lot of heavy material and homework.
- [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) - nice intro
- [Rapid Software Testing Explored](https://www.satisfice.com/rapid-software-testing-explored) with James Bach - I want to do more. Impressive
- Commercial certifications (I've done them but not worthy to be described in details)
