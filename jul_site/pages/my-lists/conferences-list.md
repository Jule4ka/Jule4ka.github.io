# Conferences list

I came to realisation that conferences and talks can and do bring value

### 2021
- TestBash Home 2021 (from Ministry of Testing, comes with Pro subscription) - not attended live, but watched some talks
    - Panel: What is Quality
    - Bullshit Alert! On the Bullshitisation of Software Testing (with Maaike Brinkhof) - simply wonderful
    - Empathy in the Foundation of Testing - didn't finish...
    - Do You Know How to Ask a Question - didn't finish...
