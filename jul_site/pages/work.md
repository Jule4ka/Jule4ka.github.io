I have 15 years of experience in software/data space, including 8+ last years dedicated to data management.
<br>
I've worked across software development, financial services and energy industries in roles such as DWH/data engineer, 
data modeler, BI analyst, implementation consultant, software automation engineer, exploratory tester. 
<br> Lately, I've deliberately shifted towards more society-oriented organizations.
At the moment, I work in the energy sector as a data and information specialist. For future assignments or roles, 
I'm looking for opportunities at the intersection of technological innovation and societal impact, 
in domains like climate, sustainability, energy or safety/defence.
<br>
Categories that keep me engaged: taste, (socio-technical) systems, complexity, knowledge, information, holism, symmathecy,
good old philosophy.
<br>
Values that I care about (based on [theory of basic human values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_basic_human_values))
: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, universalism.
<br>
<br>

#### My time, energy and headspace is for sale.
I am currently open for jobs in data/BI engineering/analysis.
