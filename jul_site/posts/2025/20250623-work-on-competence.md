### On Competence and Professionalism

I recently navigated the job search process in the Dutch market. After one memorable experience, I’ve been reflecting on the meaning and value of "competence" in the professional world. I won’t name the organization involved, as my intent is rather to share the experience and ask for opinions.
I was invited to an online interview with a potential team. The conversation went well, and I was invited to a second, in-person interview. However, upon arriving at the location, it quickly became apparent that the interviewers were under the impression it was supposed to be virtual. I found myself sitting in the reception area, surrounded by noise, conducting the interview on my phone.
Despite the mix-up, I adapted, and the interview proceeded smoothly.

A third interview was then scheduled on-site again. This time, however, the interviewer did not show up at all and was unreachable. After waiting at reception for 20 minutes with no communication, I left and decided to withdraw my application. I followed up with the recruiter, politely explaining the situation and requesting compensation for my travel expenses for this second visit. The first one, despite the inconvenience, I decided to let go.

The response? "I’ve asked this to my manager, but unfortunately, we don’t reimburse the travel cost for interviews. I understand your dissatisfaction on the process, and I agree the process was far from what we normally have here. Unfortunately, there is nothing on that part that I can help you with.”

What adds to the frustration is that this is a semi-governmental organization, meaning that, ultimately, the inefficiency and incompetence I encountered are indirectly paid for by the taxes of citizens.

Are job candidates expected to bear the costs of an organization’s errors, both financially and in terms of their time? Mistakes happen, yes. But how many times in a row should one be asked to shoulder the burden of others' incompetence? This experience truly bothered me.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Have you encountered similar situations in your job search, and how did you handle them? Should companies, especially those funded by public money, be held more accountable when things like this happen?
