I decided to join a
`Master Studies in Information systems <https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-information-systems/information-systems.html>`_.

One of the courses from last year was aimed to teach students to collaborate
and apply their knowledge to solving a complex problem in a real world project.

One of the offered working methods was lectures the aim of which was to provide enough pointers
to further help students to work structurally on the project. The lectures provided overview on
scientific research necessity and applicability as well as addressed quantitative and qualitative
research methods.

Research - Why and How
-----------------------
Goals -> Vision -> Strategy -> Research -> Innovation -> Team Work -> Growth
Type of researches:
* rationalist - criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive
* empiricist - knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience
* pragmatist - words and thought are considered as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving and action.
Reject the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent or mirror reality
* constructivist - scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community which
seeks to measure and construct models of the natural world.
* idealist - 'reality' is in some way indistinguishable or inseparable from human perception and/or understanding,
that it is in some sense mentally constructed, or that it is otherwise closely connected to ideas.
* naturalized epistemologist - considers the evolutionary role of knowledge for agents living and evolving in the workld.
* sceptics - questions the possibility of human knowledge, either in particular domains or on a general level.
