A couple of weeks ago, I had a chance to follow a Data Ethics workshop organized by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/) as part of their 'Responsible Tech' series, led by [Piek Knijff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piek-knijff/) ([Filosofie in actie](https://www.filosofieinactie.nl/)).
💥 An inspiring, valuable, and actionable day full of insights and reflection. Truly a balm on my tormented soul 🧘‍♀️🥹. 

As someone working in the data space, with years of lived experience as an intersectional minority surrounded by disproportionately substantial amounts of complacent Nederlandse mannekes, conversations about power, representation and ethics are never abstract, they are deeply personal.

**Takeaways**:

* ⚖️Ethics = systematic reflection on morals
* 🌐 Data Ethics 𝐢𝐬 **broader and messier than only Ethics of Algorithms and Models**, which is often overlooked 
* 🛠️ There are **practical models**, tools and methods to bring ethical thinking into data/tech practice, such as:
  * 'Filosofie in actie' conversation model 
  * [Canvas Data-Ethiek](https://www.filosofieinactie.nl/ethicstools)
  * [Begeleidingsethiek](https://begeleidingsethiek.nl/)
  * [Deda](https://deda.dataschool.nl/)
  * [AI Ethics Maturity Model](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00228-7)
  * [ODI Data Ethics Maturity Model](https://theodi.org/insights/tools/data-ethics-maturity-model-benchmarking-your-approach-to-data-ethics/)
  * [Tada model](https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/110506/tada.city)
* 🌱 **Ethics is emergent**. Use the 'kapstokmethode' to search for possibilities to hook ethical reflection on already existing processes and ways of working within the organization. Small consistent steps, as usual, are the key. As well as languaging. 👀 Maybe, don't call it 'ethics’ straight ahead... or some people might freak out and run away 😱🏃‍♂️
* ⚠️**Techno-solutionistic mindset is a trap**
* 🫱🏽‍🫲🏿 👩 We may never reach true objectivity, but **intersubjectivity is possible**. Ethics isn’t universal, it’s relational. What’s “right” depends on who’s at the table, who gets heard, and whose values are built into the system, and whose are left out. Neutrality is not reachable, but awareness, representation, and accountability are. 
* 🏛️ 𝐏𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐬 can offer grounding and explicit direction. Some of defined values are:
  * Privacy, security, autonomy, human dignity, justice, power relations - [Rathenau](https://www.rathenau.nl/sites/default/files/2020-09/Raad-weten-met-digitalisering-Rathenau-Instituut.pdf)
  * Human rights & dignity, peaceful & just societies, diversity, environmental flourishing - [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics)
* 📚 🤓And yes, there's so much to read about it if you're curious. Start [here](https://philarchive.org/rec/FLOWID). 

💡 Ethics doesn’t have to be abstract or paralyzing. There are ways to make it tangible, but it's a process 🏞️🚶‍♀️🧭⚖️ 🧠 🪶🛤️ 🕊️
