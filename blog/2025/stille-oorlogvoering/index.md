The World Economic Forum named 'Misinformation and disinformation' the #4 
global risk in their [Global Risks Report 2025](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/digest/), with #1 short-term impact (2 years) and #5 in the long term (10 years).

Luckily, there are plenty of initiatives in the Netherlands helping people become more aware. Yesterday, 
I attended one of them: [Stille Oorlogvoering: de wetenschap van moderne conflicten](https://www.sciencecafenijmegen.nl/terugblik/2025may19/) 🔗

<!-- TEASER_END -->

During the session, two academics shared insights on cognitive manipulation and warfare through digital means, 
and how to fight back. One of the methods discussed was pre-bunking (based on inoculation theory), which works by exposing people 
to a harmless version of misinformation so they can build resistance to similar manipulations later.

There are papers and solid theory works linked on the event page (see link above and keep scrolling down 😅).

Loveliest people, please-please-please actively protect your brains. Because if you don’t address it, it will address you. 🧠 > 🌀 + 🕳️
