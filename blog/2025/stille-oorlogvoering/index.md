### Blah blah :)

The World Economic Forum named 'Misinformation and disinformation' the #4 global risk in their Global Risks Report 2025, with #1 short-term impact (2 years) and #5 in the long term (10 years). 👉 https://lnkd.in/g8GNEM7Y

Luckily, there are plenty of initiatives in the Netherlands helping people become more aware. Yesterday, I attended one of them: Stille Oorlogvoering: de wetenschap van moderne conflicten 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gFKE933R

During the session, two academics shared insights on cognitive manipulation and warfare through digital means, and how to fight back. One of the methods discussed was pre-bunking (based on inoculation theory), which works by exposing people to a harmless version of misinformation so they can build resistance to similar manipulations later.

Loveliest people, please-please-please actively protect your brains. Because if you don’t address it, it will address you. 🧠 > 🌀 + 🕳️
